# Graph-library

An implementation for the graph data structure along with implementation of common graph algorithms

Currently added features:

Create a Graph with N vertices.
Add an unweighted edge between two vertices u,v.
Add a weighted edge between two vertices u,v.
Traverse the Graph using BFS or DFS.
Check if the Graph is cyclic.
Get the strongly connected components of a Directed Graph.
